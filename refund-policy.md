# Refund Policy

All sales are final. We do not offer refunds on any products or services once a purchase is completed.

Upon successful payment, a unique license key is automatically generated and sent to you via email. This key grants you access to the product and includes:

- Specific instructions for downloading and installing the product
- Walkthrough videos to guide you through the setup process
- Multiple ways to contact our support team if you encounter any issues

We stand behind the quality of our products:

- If you encounter bugs or technical issues, we will work with you to resolve them promptly.
- If essential features are missing or not working as described, we will prioritize addressing them where feasible.

It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that their system meets any technical requirements before purchase. If you're unsure, please reach out to our support team prior to buying.

By completing your purchase, you acknowledge that:

- You are receiving full access to the product immediately upon payment
- You understand how to install and use the product based on the materials provided
- You agree to this refund policy and waive any right to initiate a chargeback for delivered digital goods

If you have any questions or concerns, our support team is always here to help.
