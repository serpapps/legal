## 2. License & Permitted Use

Upon purchase, the Company grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the software for your own internal business or personal purposes, subject to any license limits (e.g., number of users, domains, or installations) disclosed at the time of purchase.

You authorize us and our payment processors to charge the payment method you provide for all purchases, renewals, add-ons, and applicable taxes.

## 4. Refund Policy

# Refund Policy

All sales are final. We do not offer refunds on any products or services once a purchase is completed.

Upon successful payment, a unique license key is automatically generated and sent to the email address you provided at checkout. This grants you immediate access to the software and includes:

- Instructions for downloading and installing the product
- Walkthrough videos to help with setup
- Multiple ways to contact our support team in case you need assistance

We stand behind the quality of our products:

- If you encounter bugs or technical issues, we will work with you to resolve them promptly.
- If essential features are missing or not working as described, we will prioritize addressing them where feasible.

It is your responsibility to ensure your system meets any technical requirements before purchasing. If youâ€™re unsure, please reach out to our team before completing your purchase.

By making a purchase, you agree to this refund policy and acknowledge that:

- You are receiving immediate access to the product and license key
- Delivery is complete when the email with license and instructions is sent
- You waive any right to initiate a chargeback or dispute on the basis of non-refundability for delivered digital goods

If you have any concerns or need help with your order, please contact us. We're here to support you.

Refund requests are governed by our [Refund Policy](https://github.com/serpapps/legal/blob/main/refund-policy.md). Unless otherwise required by law, all sales are considered final once the license key or download link has been delivered.

## 5. Updates & Support

We may release updates, bug fixes, or new features from time to time. Unless your purchase explicitly includes ongoing support, we make no guarantee regarding future updates or technical assistance. When support is provided, it is limited to reasonable efforts to address product defects or setup questions.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Some Services may interface with third-party platforms (such as payment processors, CRM systems, or video hosting providers). Your use of those platforms is subject to their own terms and policies. We are not responsible for any third-party service outages, changes, or limitations that impact the functionality of our Services.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights in the Services remain with the Company or its licensors. Trademarks, logos, and product names referenced are the property of their respective owners. Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of any intellectual property rights to you.

## 8. Acceptable Use & Compliance

You agree not to use the Services to violate any applicable laws, regulations, or rights of third parties, including intellectual property rights and privacy laws.

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits or data, arising out of or related to your use of the Services.

Our total cumulative liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Services is limited to the amount you paid for the applicable product in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with the Services shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
